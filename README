# 🚀 Algo Odyssey  
### Competitive Coding Meets the Campus

Algo Odyssey is an **AI-powered, institution-focused competitive coding platform** designed to transform how students practice programming, improve algorithmic thinking, and prepare for technical interviews.  
It combines **timed challenges, automated evaluation, adaptive ranking, and AI-driven integrity enforcement** to create a fair, engaging, and industry-aligned coding ecosystem.

---

## 📌 Why Algo Odyssey?

While global coding platforms exist, they often fail to meet **institution-level needs** such as authenticated participation, fair evaluation, and academic integrity.  
Algo Odyssey is built specifically to address these gaps.

**What makes it different?**
- Institution-only access using verified credentials
- Regular, discipline-enforcing challenge cycles
- Evaluation based on *correctness + efficiency + behavior*
- AI-based plagiarism and malpractice detection
- Transparent, adaptive ranking (APERA model)

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Encourage **consistent and disciplined coding practice**
- Improve **algorithmic efficiency and optimization skills**
- Simulate **real interview-style, time-constrained environments**
- Promote **healthy peer competition**
- Ensure **fairness and academic integrity**
- Prepare students for **placements, hackathons, and contests**
