Algo Odyssey – Competitive Coding Meets the Campus

--------------------------------------------------

PROJECT OVERVIEW

Algo Odyssey is an institutional-level competitive coding platform designed to improve students’ programming, algorithmic thinking, and problem-solving skills through structured, time-bound challenges. The platform is developed specifically for academic institutions and focuses on fairness, consistency, and integrity in coding assessments.

A new coding challenge is released every three days. Students must solve the problem within a fixed time window. Submissions are evaluated not only for correctness but also for execution efficiency, inferred time complexity, and historical performance. Students who do not participate in a challenge receive zero points, enforcing discipline and regular engagement.

The system integrates automated code evaluation, adaptive ranking, and AI-based plagiarism and malpractice detection, making it suitable for interview preparation, competitive programming practice, and institutional assessments.

--------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVES

1. Encourage consistent coding practice through scheduled challenges.
2. Improve algorithmic thinking and optimization skills.
3. Simulate real-world interview-style, time-constrained coding environments.
4. Promote healthy peer competition within the institution.
5. Ensure fairness using adaptive, multi-factor ranking.
6. Preserve academic integrity using AI-driven monitoring.

RANKING AND EVALUATION MODEL

The platform uses an adaptive ranking algorithm that evaluates submissions based on:

- Code correctness
- Execution time
- Inferred time and space complexity
- Plagiarism score
- Historical performance
- Timely participation

This ensures fair ranking and discourages brute-force or copied solutions.

--------------------------------------------------

SECURITY MEASURES

- JWT-based secure authentication
- Institution-only access using verified credentials
- Sandboxed code execution using Docker
- Secure API endpoints
- AI-powered plagiarism and malpractice detection
- Encrypted user credentials

--------------------------------------------------

TESTING CONDUCTED

- Backend API unit testing
- Automated code evaluation testing
- Load testing for concurrent users
- Authentication and security testing
- AI monitoring validation
- UI and usability testing

--------------------------------------------------

RESULTS AND IMPACT

- Improved student code correctness
- Increased optimized and efficient solutions
- Higher participation and engagement
- Significant reduction in plagiarism cases
- Better preparation for technical interviews
