# 🚀 Algo Odyssey – Competitive Coding Meets the Campus

Algo Odyssey is an **institution-level competitive coding platform** designed to cultivate consistent coding practice, algorithmic thinking, and fair competition among students.
Built as a **final-year engineering project**, it bridges the gap between academic learning and real-world technical expectations through **timed challenges, automated evaluation, adaptive ranking, and AI-driven integrity checks**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Algo Odyssey provides a **structured, gamified, and secure coding ecosystem** where students participate in **time-bound challenges released every 3 days**.
Unlike generic global platforms, it is **tailored for institutional use**, ensuring:

* Authenticated access using **University Seat Number + College Email**
* **Efficiency-aware evaluation** (not just correctness)
* **Zero-point penalty** for missed challenges to enforce consistency
* **AI-based plagiarism & malpractice detection**
* Transparent and adaptive **ranking via APERA model**

The platform prepares students for **technical interviews, hackathons, and industry-level coding assessments**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Promote **regular and disciplined coding practice**
2. Encourage **optimized, scalable, and efficient solutions**
3. Simulate **real interview-like, time-constrained environments**
4. Foster **healthy peer competition** within the institution
5. Ensure **academic integrity** using AI-based monitoring
6. Provide **data-driven performance analytics** for students and admins

## 📊 Ranking & Evaluation Model (APERA)

Algo Odyssey uses **APERA (Adaptive Plagiarism-aware Efficiency-based Ranking Algorithm)** which evaluates submissions based on:

* ✅ Correctness (test case pass rate)
* ⏱ Execution time
* 📈 Time & space complexity (inferred)
* 📚 Historical performance
* 🚫 Plagiarism score
* 🕒 Timely participation

This ensures **fair, adaptive, and industry-aligned rankings** rather than brute-force scoring.

---

## 🔐 Security Measures

* JWT-based secure authentication
* Institutional email validation
* Docker sandbox for code execution
* Isolated runtime environments
* AI-driven integrity enforcement
* Encrypted credentials
* Secure API routing

---

## 🧪 Testing Conducted

* Unit testing for backend APIs
* Code execution validation with edge cases
* Load testing for concurrent users
* Security testing for authentication & sandboxing
* AI model testing for false positives/negatives
* UI/UX testing for usability & responsiveness

---
