## 📌 Why Algo Odyssey?

While global coding platforms exist, they often fail to meet **institution-level needs** such as authenticated participation, fair evaluation, and academic integrity.  
Algo Odyssey is built specifically to address these gaps.

**What makes it different?**
- Institution-only access using verified credentials
- Regular, discipline-enforcing challenge cycles
- Evaluation based on *correctness + efficiency + behavior*
- AI-based plagiarism and malpractice detection
- Transparent, adaptive ranking (APERA model)

## 🎯 Objectives

- Encourage **consistent and disciplined coding practice**
- Improve **algorithmic efficiency and optimization skills**
- Simulate **real interview-style, time-constrained environments**
- Promote **healthy peer competition**
- Ensure **fairness and academic integrity**
- Prepare students for **placements, hackathons, and contests**
